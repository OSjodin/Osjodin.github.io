			Congratulations on finding the secret mobile page! To access this 
			page, all you need to do is click the menu button twice. 
			</p>
			<p>
			For now, might I suggest the <a href="#" onclick="javascript:SlideMobile(1);">About Me</a> option, or perhaps 
			<a href="#" onclick="javascript:SlideMobile(2)">take a peak on a few projects,</a> You can always find your way back here
			</p>
			<p>
			Every single page from the menu you've visited are nothing but blank canvas for however you
			want your site to be. Another good reason to add to the list of <a href="#" onclick="SlideMobile(4)">
			why you might want to hire a web developer</a>
			</p>
			<p>
			More users browse the web on phones than ever before, and that's a trend that keeps increasing.
			Having a fast, sleek, and captivating design that keeps users attention without being too much
			is a must. Nothing makes people more annoyed than a slow website. And no one wants to be on a site
			that doens't engadge you back!
