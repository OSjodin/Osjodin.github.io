<h2>Where to begin</h2>
<p>
<h3>I'd like to think</h3> I'm a decent developer in most languages, while I cannot claim major proficiency in all of them, I do find myself quite capable in PHP, JavaScript, Python and MATLAB,
I've seen and done things in C/C++ and Java as well, although that was many, many years ago. I have however found that it's often not the language in itself, but rather the method. When I started
the project with the Robot, I had barley even touched Python, but after a few days of getting used to and seeing the structure, it felt like second nature and things just went on.

<h3>I find myself quite capable</h3> in the backend of things, sometimes it's difficult to know exactly where to start, but once you do, you get a grip and it just continues forward, the front end and design aspect of things doesn't come quite as easy to me. Like most people I can look at something and notice that something seems wrong or a little bit off, but I can't really tell what that is, quite frankly, it's a miracle this site looks as decent as it does.

<h2>And that's primarily it</h2>
<p>
<h3>So without this part turning into a novel,</h3> my skills lie mostly in the development of functions and features, be it for a robot that is to autonomously insert and remove bottles from a printer, or functions for a website, while this is just one big HTML file in GitHub, there is quite a lot of PHP behind it to create that HTML file. I have ultimately decided to include them in a folder called "etc", as I am putting this project on the shelf for now, as I've decided to take what I learned here, and start another website-project with better functions and features, including an actual SQL Database. And trying to incorporate semantic HTML in a better way from the start while still maintaining the dynamic aspect
