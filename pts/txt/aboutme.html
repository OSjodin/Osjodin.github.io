<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p>
	<h3>I'm Hans Sj√∂din,</h3> a passionate web designer and developer from Sweden. At 29 years old,
	I have dedicated myself to create appealing, functional, and responsive websites
	that leave a lasting impression.
</p>

<p>
With a love for coding and creating beautiful solutions to whatever problem comes my way,
I'm continuously learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development.
This allows me to bring fresh ideas and innovative solutions to every project I undertake.
I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and also knowledgeable in Python, VisualBasic, Assembly, C++ and MATLAB.
Always ready and willing to take on new exciting challenges.
</p><p></p>

<h2>How do we do this?</h2>
<p>
I believe the best results are achieved when working together. I enjoy engaging with clients, 
understanding their goals, and translating their visions into reality. 
</p>

<p>
When I'm not immersed infront of a screen, you can find me on the disc-golf course, or rather,
outside the course where I often end up spending way too much time search for my missing discs.
</p><p></p>

<h3>Thank you</h3>
<p>
for visiting my website, and feel free to poke around. If you have any inquiries or would like to discuss a project,
don't hesitate to reach out. I'm eager to hear about your ideas and how we may work together to create something we're both proud of.
</p>
