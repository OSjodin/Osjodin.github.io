	Once upon a time as a youngling, fresh out of my first webdesign class, my professor, a master in
	the art of surfing (the web), could smell my hubris from a mile away. He pulled me aside and laid
	down the law. Today I will share his sacred words.
</p>
<p>
	<b>1. Thou shalt keep it responsive:</b>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		Make sure your website looks fly on all devices, from big-ass desktop screens to tiny mobile screens. Responsiveness is the name of the game.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<b>2. Thou shalt not go overboard with flash(y) graphics:</b> 
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		Yeah, we all love some eye candy, 
		but too much of it can slow down your site and drive visitors insane. Keep it clean, sleek, and 
		lightning fast. (A different time for sure. RIP Flash, may you never return)
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<b>3. Thou shalt embrace the power of white space:</b> 
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		don't be afraid of empty spaces. 
		White space is like a breath of fresh air for your design. It gives your content room to breathe 
		and makes it easier on the eyes.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<b>4. Thou shalt slay the typography game:</b> 
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		Fonts are like tattoos for your website. 
		Choose them wisely, make them legible, and keep them consistent. No one likes to squint to read 
		your gnarly content.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<b>5. Thou shalt make navigation a breeze:</b> 
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		Ain't nobody got time for confusing menus. 
		Keep your navigation simple, intuitive, and in your visitor's face. They should be able to 
		find what they need with no more than a few clicks.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<b>6. Thou shalt optimize for speed:</b>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		Nobody likes waiting for a website 
		to load. Optimize your images, minify your code, and do whatever it takes to make your site 
		lightning fast.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<b>7. Thou shalt be mobile-friendly:</b>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		Mobile is where it's at. More people browse the web on 
		their phones than ever before. So, make sure your site is mobile-friendly, or you'll be missing 
		out on some serious traffic.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<b>8. Thou shalt be dynamic:</b> 
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		They say it's the inside that counts, and it couldn't
		be more true for web development. As beautiful your site is on the outside, so shall it be on the inside.
		Upon completion, a single tear of pure joy shall be shed, by how beautifully dynamic and pretty your code is.
	</p>	
</p>
<p>
	<b>9. Thou shalt test like no tomorrow:</b>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		Don't be lazy. Test your site on different browsers and devices. 
		Fix those bugs, polish that UI, and make sure your visitors have a smooth ride, no matter which board
		they choose to surf the web on.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<b>10. Thou shalt stay updated:</b>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		The web world is always evolving young padewan. Stay on top of the latest 
		trends, tools, and technologies. Keep learning, keep growing, and keep pushing the boundaries of 
		your web design skills.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
There you have it. The 10 commandments of webdesign. As laid out to me by the man who for all intents
and purposes, were our web-surfing Jesus.
