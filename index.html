	A fun and recent project has been creating what I would call, the "BottleBot", it comes as an extension to a particular brand of UV Printer and its purpose is to automate the task of printing multiple bottles. A task normally done manually by hand for this type of printer. 
</p>
<p>
	Took about 3 month to make and the end result is a prototype that can communicate with the printer and autonomously print up to 20 bottles in one batch. The process was quite interesting and as the sole developer of the system, I had quite a lot on my plate. Everything from the code doing what it is supposed to do, building the physical platform, to sorting out the communication between Printer and Robot.
</p>
<p>
First step was to test the limits of the Robot, understand what it can, and can't do. After that I started building the underlying framework for moving it. Hardcoded in certain positions and watching as the Robot performs the movements. A stop button was installed for safety, and an emergency stop button, difference between them being that one simply halts the robot in place, while the other cuts off the power completely. As the API worked with the robot, there was no pre-existing way of continuing operations after a stop has occurred, sounds easy enough, just make it continue to do what it did before you pressed stop... yeah...
</p>
<p>
One of those things that sounds so easy, but actually making it work is a different matter, the stop function is a pre-existing feature where you set a 24v input port as the emergency stop, and the moment it receives a signal the stop is triggered, and an error is raised, the robot will not do anything until the error flag is removed. That signal and flag supersedes everything else, the code will keep running, and once the next move-command is sent, you will get an error in return as the robot cannot perform the motion.
</p>
<p>
After dealing with that and putting in significant work, essentially re-working how the robot accept commands, writing new ones to replace the existing, we now had a stop button that once pressed would stop, and a separate start button that would make it go again, from where it left off. I even took the time to "idiot proof" the function to make sure I couldn't make any mistakes. Because a mistake at the wrong time, could cost a very significant amount of money should the printer become damaged.

	Content Management System (CMS) tools such as <b>Wordpress, Joomla, Squarespace</b> &amp; many more, have revolutionized the way websites and online platforms are created and managed, and made web design more available. I've worked with most of them, and there are so many great pre build functions. <b>However</b>, it is important to recognize that CMS tools also come with their fair share of disadvantages. 
</p>
<p>
	</p><h3>1. Limited Customization:</h3>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		One of the primary disadvantages of CMS tools is the limited customization options they offer. While CMS platforms provide a variety of templates and themes, they often restrict the ability to customize the design and layout extensively. Users may find themselves constrained by the predetermined options and struggle to achieve a unique and tailored website appearance.
	</p>
<p></p>
<p>
	</p><h3>2. Performance Limitations:</h3>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		CMS tools can introduce performance limitations, particularly when it comes to website speed and responsiveness. The additional layers of code and plugins required by CMS platforms can slow down website loading times. Moreover, as CMS tools are designed to accommodate a wide range of functionalities, they may generate bloated and inefficient code, negatively impacting overall performance.
	</p>
<p></p>
<p>	
	</p><h3>3. Security Vulnerabilities:</h3>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		While CMS tools aim to provide secure environments, they can be susceptible to security vulnerabilities. Hackers often target widely-used CMS platforms, exploiting weaknesses in their code or plugins. Failure to promptly update CMS software or install security patches can leave websites vulnerable to cyber attacks, potentially resulting in data breaches or defacement.
	</p>
<p></p>
<p>
	</p><h3>4. Learning Curve and Dependency:</h3>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		CMS tools, despite their user-friendly interfaces, often have a steep learning curve. Users must familiarize themselves with the platform's functionalities and sometimes even learn basic coding concepts. Additionally, reliance on CMS tools can create a dependency, making it difficult to transition to a different system or to implement custom functionalities not supported by the CMS platform.
	</p>
<p></p>
<p>
	</p><h3>5. Limitations in Scalability:</h3>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		As websites grow and expand, CMS tools may present limitations in terms of scalability. Handling large volumes of content or accommodating complex e-commerce requirements can strain the capabilities of some CMS platforms. Scaling up the website's infrastructure or implementing custom features may require significant modifications to the CMS codebase, leading to potential compatibility issues and increased development costs.
	</p>
<p></p>
<p>
	</p><h3>6. Cost and Licensing:</h3>
	<p class="tab1 top0">
		While many CMS tools offer free or open-source versions, certain advanced features and functionalities may come at a cost. Licensing fees for premium CMS versions or additional plugins can accumulate over time, increasing the overall expenses associated with using CMS tools. Small businesses or individuals on a tight budget may find these costs prohibitive.
